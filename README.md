ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Clara-Casabona, a PHD Student at the Integrative Ecology Lab, UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke. 

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ecology, statistical modelling, biodiversity change, population dynamics and open science.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently building an R package to estimate extinctions and colonization probabilities for species
